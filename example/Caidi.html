      <h1>Welcome!      </h1>
      <p>
      Nadia Caidi is Associate Professor at <a href="https://ischool.utoronto.ca/">the University of Toronto’s Faculty of Information (iSchool)</a>. Trained in Linguistics and Communication from Lyon and Grenoble (France), she holds a Ph.D. in Information Studies from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Professor Caidi’s research interests focus on human information behaviour and information policy. She has received grants from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada for research on information control and the public’s right to know in times of crisis and in the context of national security. She has received several research grants for her work on the information practices of vulnerable communities, including newcomers and Aboriginal communities in remote and isolated communities in Ontario. She has published extensively on these topics in top refereed journals. Her current research is situated in the context of global migration and the role that information resources, institutions, and technologies play in the everyday lives of migrant and refugee communities. Professor Caidi was President of the Canadian Association for Information Science from 2010-11 and the 2016 President of the International Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&T).</p>
      <h2><a name="research" id="research"></a><br>
      research</h2>
      <p>My research connects contemporary questions in information science to theoretical and methodological traditions in the critical, interpretive, and historical social sciences. Theoretically, my work is shaped by ideas and traditions coming out of American pragmatism, critical theory, and post-structuralism.&nbsp;Methodologically, I’m most informed by research traditions dedicated to the naturalistic understanding of order, value, and meaning  as defining attributes of human activity in the world.&nbsp;Mostly that means ethnography, usually of the sort practiced in qualitative sociology and anthropology; but I also draw on allied traditions of work in philosophy, history, public policy, design, science and technology studies (STS), some forms of media and cultural studies (including new media art), and interpretivist strains of information science sub-fields like Human-Computer Interaction and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work. My research has been supported by grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation (including an NSF CAREER award), the Social Science Research Council, Ford Foundation, Sloan Foundation, World Bank, Intel, and the Canadian Social Science and Humanities Research Council. My current projects tend to fall into the following areas (see 'writing' below for links to some relevant papers):<br>
        <br>
        <em><strong>Infrastructure and collaboration:</strong></em><br>
        My work has long been engaged with theoretical and practical problems of infrastructure: social and material forms foundational to collective human action of all kinds. This includes a long series of projects around new computational and data infrastructures in the sciences and how these have shifted forms of practice, value and collaboration (not always in ways anticipated by their designers and proponents).&nbsp;More recently, my interest has turned to problems of infrastructure and collaboration in fields beyond the sciences - for example, fine art furniture production, robotic surgery, and experimental music. This has sparked in turn a new fascination with the nature and role of improvisation in collaborative life - more on this soon!</p>
      <p><em><strong>Breakdown, maintenance and repair</strong></em>: <br>
        I am endlessly fascinated by problems of repair, and have argued both theoretically and ethnographically for breakdown, maintenance and repair as central but neglected moments in our individual and collective relationships with technology. Repair also happens to be an excellent starting point for rethinking many central assumptions in the technology world, from design, to sustainability, to the nature and location of skill and innovation. These questions have led to ethnographic projects with mobile phone repair workers around the world (incuding Namibia and Bangladesh); with amateur fixer movements in Europe and North America; and to collaborative projects with interactive and new media artists (like <a href="http://cornellhci.org/scale/">this one</a>).</p>
      <p><strong><em>Global computing</em></strong>:<br>
        Many of my theoretical and ethnographic interests are driven by the desire to arrive at a more truly global story of computing (instead of one that inevitably starts in Silicon Valley and diffuses out, sometimes, from there). This includes instances of technology development oriented to concerns and communities in the global South, as shows up under the (badly-named) field of ICTD (Information and Communication Technologies for Development). More often it involves taking stock of sociotechnical practices and dynamics (often novel and highly innovative ones) that play out under the radically varying social, economic, cultural and infrastructural conditions to be found around the world (though much of my own work has been in South and Southeast Asia). I've been deeply fortunate to have worked with and learned from a wonderful set of students and collaborators in this space. <br>
      </p>
      <p><strong><em>Technology ethics, law and policy</em></strong>:<br>
        Finally, my research addresses problems of technology ethics, law and policy, both as (inexhaustible!) site of problems and controversies, and as target for research impact. This includes work in research, science, and international development policy; but also periodic engagements with areas ranging from telecommunications and First Amendment law to privacy and intellectual property. I'm especially interested in the messy and uncertain moments in which new technologies meet unsettled ethical and legal terrains, and the processes and controversies by which these uncertainties get reduced, codified, and laid down as structure and precedent. </p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://sjackson.infosci.cornell.edu/Jackson%20INFO%20POLICY%20syllabus%2023apr12.pdf">INFO 1200: Information Ethics, Law, and Policy <br>
      </a></strong>This course investigates the ethical, legal, and social foundations of contemporary information technology. Through lectures, readings, and independent projects, we will analyze and engage contemporary challenges ranging from privacy in big data, mobile computing and national security environments, to the nature of innovation, property, and collaboration in an increasingly networked world. The course draws on cases from the fields of science, health care, education, politics, and international development, but above all it draws on YOUR experiences as a user, consumer, builder, and contributor to the global world of technology.&nbsp; Through this course you’ll learn about the key frameworks, processes, laws and institutions that govern the contemporary world of technology, along with key theories and methods from the academic fields that shape and inform them (law, philosophy, political science, economics, communication, sociology, management, etc.).&nbsp;But above all you’ll learn to engage critically and strategically with the worlds of information and technology around you, deciding what kind of information consumer, user, and citizen YOU want to be. </p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://sjackson.infosci.cornell.edu/IS6210%20InfoTechSociety%20syllabus%208nov12.pdf">INFO 6210: Information, Technology, and Society </a></strong><br>
        This is a core course for the IS doctoral program, and exposes students to key concepts, debates, and the historical development of critical and interpretive work in information science (including tracing some of that work back to its origins in other fields – sociology, anthropology, philosophy, political science and public policy, communication, etc.). It also builds methodological skills and experience in the doing of qualitative, interpretative, and critical research in information science today.  <br>
